I think the most important thing is consistency and not going against the grain when working in your team at your future job. It's not wrong to use things previously made popular (var and semicolons), but here at WDI we teach the latest standards and recommendations. That being said, when you're browsing the internet for answers and reading source code, you will definitely see older syntax, and you'll have to just learn how to read it and convert it to your personal style.
